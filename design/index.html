                <p>
                    When I joined the design team, they had a web app pilot
                    that had been running for a year. The app
                    was built for small business owners to open
                    and manage a business checking account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with researchers, designers and
                    stakeholders throughout Capital One, I dug
                    into the effectiveness of the pilot web app
                    by looking at analytics data, speaking to
                    customers and running usability tests. We
                    discovered what was able to convert
                    customers and get them to make an initial
                    deposit into their account.

                <h4>Design Research</h4>
                <p>
                    Reviewing analytics with customer
                    experience, customer support and development
                    teams revealed a low conversion rate, along
                    with a gap in how conversions were being
                    tracked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that many potential customers
                    abandoned during document verification
                    because the process was unclear, which was
                    the bulk of calls to customer support. We
                    looked deeper into this problem with
                    participants during usability sessions.

                <p>
                    The Human Resources portal for Kaiser
                    Permanente that serves over 160,000
                    employees across six regions, with 40,000
                    transactions per day. It had been created
                    ten years earlier and was painful for
                    employees to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our challenge was to design an engaging,
                    easy-to-use system for employees required to
                    use the portal, while making content updates
                    clear for our partners in Benefits,
                    Retirement, and Payroll.

                <p>
                    We visited employees in company cafeterias,
                    made appointments with administrators and
                    hospital staff to learn how people were
                    using the HR Portal and what we could do to
                    improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Findability was key. People were having a
                    difficult time sorting through all of the
                    options. The order wasn't clear and there
                    were so many things that an employee can do
                    (and is required to do) on the HR Portal.

                <h4>Style Guide</h4>
                <p>
                    Because we knew we had to work with multiple
                    groups, we focucsed our efforts on creating
                    a <a href="https://myhrwd-status.herokuapp.com/guidelines.html">style guide</a> for the site. In order to
                    facilitate collecting design decisions for
                    developers and content strategists to
                    reference, I created a style guide and hired
                    an intern to help me complete it.

                    The CIO Chief of Staff approached our team

                    location services pilot for iPad and iPhone.
                    We helped department staff locate one
                    another, find patients and equipment to
                    improve operational efficiency.

                <p>
                    HIPPA restricts me from sharing photos of the pilot.
                    We piloted the app for 5 weeks and found
                    there was poor adopting. Research and
                    interviews confirmed the sentiment to be
                    against adoption. Communication they had was
                    working. We learned that for all Kaiser
                    Permanente hospitals with installed RTLS
                    systems, this was not the best approach.

                    <strong>How do we stay healthy?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been curious about the relationship
                    between health and new technology, because
                    computer use is frequently a sedentary
                    activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project began as a series of 
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonfireschool/">
                    stories on Facebook</a> to understand
                    the community and evolved to include public
                    classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm researching wellbeing
                    across cultures, to understand how
                    restorative practices &ndash; the things we do as
                    humans to regain equilibrium when we fall
                    off-balance &ndash; are passed on to future
                    generations.

                <h4>Public Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    These classes aim to make learning with an
                    industry professional fun and engaging.
                    Through a series of group exercises student
                    are prompted to think about the needs of
                    others and how we can solve their problems
                    with software.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>There are three main concepts in this series, each with itâ€™s own class.<dt>
                    <dd><a href="https://github.com/bonfireschool/classes/blob/master/2017-03-sfpl-learn.md">Learn to find human needs for software</a></dd>
                    <dd><a href="https://github.com/bonfireschool/classes/blob/master/2017-03-sfpl-design.md">Design software based on human needs</a></dd>
                    <dd><a href="https://github.com/bonfireschool/classes/blob/master/2017-03-sfpl-build.md">Build software with Python using design</a></dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    In this series, student learn to listen and
                    spend time with others to know what they
                    need; we design software based on those
                    needs and draw pictures to tell the story of
                    what we can build; then we build software
                    with Python and change it until it meets the
                    needs we've identified.

                    <strong>Typography and print projects</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heavily inspired by <a href="http://emigre.com/">Emigre</a> 
                    and <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1920/jan-tschichold/">Jan Tschichold</a>, 
                    I've created my own graphic design since the
                    early 1990s. As a typesetter for a
                    letterpress print shop, I studied the craft
                    and history of typography. Though I produce
                    less print work these days, I am grounded in
                    the principles of modern graphic design.
