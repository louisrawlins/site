                    location services pilot for iPad and iPhone.
                    We helped department staff locate one
                    another, find patients and equipment to
                    improve operational efficiency.
                </p>

                    nurses on the ground. We set a baseline for

                    over a 5 week period.

                    Holy shit. Getting RTLS and the
                    infrastructure coordinated took forever. We
                    made partnerships with people everywhere to
                    make things move as fast as possible.

                    We piloted the app for 5 weeks and found
                    there was poor adopting. Research and
                    interviews confirmed the sentiment to be
                    against adoption. Communication they had was
                    working. We learned that for all Kaiser
                    Permanente hospitals with installed RTLS
                    systems, this was not the best approach.

                <p>
                    The Human Resources portal for Kaiser
                    Permanente that serves over 160,000
                    employees across six regions, with 40,000
                    transactions per day. It had been created
                    ten years earlier and was painful for
                    employees to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our challenge was to design an engaging,
                    easy-to-use system for employees required to
                    use the portal, while making content updates
                    clear for our partners in Benefits,
                    Retirement, and Payroll.

                <h4>Style Guide</h4>
                <p>
                    Because we knew we had to work with multiple
                    groups, we focucsed our efforts on creating
                    a <a href="https://myhrwd-status.herokuapp.com/guidelines.html">style guide</a> for the site. In order to
                    facilitate collecting design decisions for
                    developers and content strategists to
                    reference, I created a style guide and hired
                    an intern to help me complete it.

                    Findability was key. People were having a
                    difficult time sorting through all of the
                    options. The order wasn't clear and there
                    were so many things that an employee can do
                    (and is required to do) on the HR Portal.

                    <strong>How do we stay healthy?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been curious about the relationship
                    between health and new technology, because
                    computer use is frequently a sedentary
                    activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project began as a series of 
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonfireschool/">
                    stories on Facebook</a> to understand
                    the community and evolved to include public
                    classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm researching wellbeing
                    across cultures, to understand how
                    restorative practices &ndash; the things we do as
                    humans to regain equilibrium when we fall
                    off-balance &ndash; are passed on to future
                    generations.

                <h4>Public Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    These classes aim to make learning with an
                    industry professional fun and engaging.
                    Through a series of group exercises student
                    are prompted to think about the needs of
                    others and how we can solve their problems
                    with software.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class.<dt>

                </dl>
                <p>
                    In this series, student learn to listen and
                    spend time with others to know what they
                    need; we design software based on those
                    needs and draw pictures to tell the story of
                    what we can build; then we build software
                    with Python and change it until it meets the
                    needs we've identified.

                    Heavily inspired by <a href="http://emigre.com/">Emigre</a> 
                    and <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1920/jan-tschichold/">Jan Tschichold</a>, 
                    I've created my own graphic design since the
                    early 1990s. As a typesetter for a
                    letterpress print shop, I studied the craft
                    and history of typography. Though I produce
                    less print work these days, I am grounded in
                    modern graphic design.
