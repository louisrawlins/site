                <p>
                    The CIO Chief of Staff approached our
                    team to create emergency department
                    real-time location services pilot for
                    iPad and iPhone. We helped department
                    staff locate one another, find patients
                    and equipment to improve operational
                    efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We worked with business, infrastructure teams, clinical directors, doctors and nurses on the ground.
                    We set a baseline for success, driving for adopting of the app over a 5 week period.

                    We piloted the app for 5 weeks and found there was poor adopting.
                    Research and interviews confirmed the sentiment to be against adoption. Communication they had was working.

                    We learned that for all Kaiser Permanente hospitals with installed RTLS systems, this was not the best approach.

                    <strong>How do we stay healthy?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been curious about the relationship
                    between health and new technology, because
                    computer use is frequently a sedentary
                    activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project began as a series of 
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonfireschool/">
                    stories on Facebook</a> to understand
                    the community and evolved to include public
                    classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I'm researching wellbeing
                    across cultures, to understand how
                    restorative practices &ndash; the things we do as
                    humans to regain equilibrium when we fall
                    off-balance &ndash; are passed on to future
                    generations.

                <h4>Public Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    These classes aim to make learning with an
                    industry professional fun and engaging.
                    Through a series of group exercises student
                    are prompted to think about the needs of
                    others and how we can solve their problems
                    with software.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class.<dt>

                    <dd><a href="https://github.com/bonfireschool/classes/blob/master/2017-03-sfpl-design.md">Design software based on human needs</a></dd>

                </dl>
                <p>
                    In this series, student learn to listen and
                    spend time with others to know what they
                    need; we design software based on those
                    needs and draw pictures to tell the story of
                    what we can build; then we build software
                    with Python and change it until it meets the
                    needs we've identified.
