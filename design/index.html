                    Hello, my name is Louis.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a design lead and user experience
                    professional. In my career, I've set type in print shops,
                    exhibited interactive media art, and built
                    mobile and web apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I lead teams to build software and services
                    informed by user research, software analytics and
                    performance data.
                </p>

                    <strong>Sign-in and first time experience.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Spark Business web and mobile app lets
                    small business owners open and manage a
                    business checking account. When I joined the
                    design team, the Spark Business pilot had
                    been running for a year without clear
                    performance metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with researchers, designers,
                    developers and stakeholders throughout
                    Capital One to dig into the effectiveness of
                    the pilot. We reviewed analytics data, spoke
                    to customers and ran usability tests. This
                    information revealed the ideal path for
                    small business customers to open an account
                    and make their first deposit.

                <h4>Design Research</h4>
                <p>
                    After a thorough review of existing user
                    research reports, I worked with the
                    analytics and customer experience teams to
                    understand the data we had collected during
                    the pilot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found low conversion rates when potential
                    customers abandoned the account opening
                    process, especially during long wait times.
                    The customer
                    support team confirmed that almost half of all
                    support calls were regarding document
                    verification or account status during
                    enrollment. We looked deeper into this
                    problem during in-person and remote
                    usability sessions.

                <h4>Usability Studies</h4>
                <p>
                    Comparing analytics and customer support
                    data with remote usability findings showed
                    that we were barely getting half of out
                    customers through the account opening
                    process. I partnered with a researcher in
                    Virginia and we ran two in-person studies to
                    learn more about the tone and expectation so
                    we could improve the experience and build
                    trust with our customers.

                <h4>User Experience Design</h4>
                <p>
                    Working alongside developers in the Spark
                    Business web and mobile product teams, I
                    created wireframes for weekly releases, as
                    well as a proposal for an overhaul to the
                    authentication system. To update
                    authentication, I worked with Capital One
                    consumer product teams for Wallet, Money and
                    SwiftID. The feedback I collected helped us
                    build a consistent content strategy and user
                    experience for Spark Business on web,
                    Android and iPhone.

                <p>
                    The Human Resources portal for Kaiser
                    Permanente serves over 160,000 employees
                    across six United States regions and is the
                    most-used internal website with 40,000
                    transactions per day. It was created ten
                    years earlier and had become a burden for
                    employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Employees must visit the portal to view
                    paychecks, do compliance training and update
                    health benefits. The challenge was to
                    redesign the website in a way that made
                    resources easier to use and easier to update
                    for our partners in Payroll, Compliance and
                    Benefits.

                <p>
                    Building on years of research before I
                    joined the team, I worked with a design
                    researcher to create a set of usability
                    heuristics so we could measure our findings
                    from remote and in-person research sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We mapped the information architecture for the
                    portal overall, then created journey maps
                    for specific subject areas like benefits,
                    payroll and employee satisfaction surveys.
                    As part of the design research team, I
                    visited employees in company cafeterias, sat
                    down with hospital staff in their offices
                    and ran remote sessions to learn how they
                    used the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These usability sessions showed that
                    findability was key. During compliance
                    training, employees frequently clicked a
                    banner ad linked to a compliance activity
                    instead of searching or browsing on the
                    portal. My team knew we could make things better.

                    and managed an intern to create design
                    patterns based on visual design and feedback
                    front-end developers. We created HTML and
                    CSS for navigation, news articles and
                    discussions to visualize website components
                    for developers and content strategists. The
                    guide also included icons, accessibility
                    color standards and a recommendations for
                    applying layouts.

                    During weekly design sessions, I documented
                    a redesign strategy using the current and
                    future information architecture. My team
                    used this strategy to guide where and when
                    we implemented each wireframe. These
                    wireframes showed a simplified
                    navigation and clear interactions on web
                    and mobile.

                    Like our wireframes, I
                    created a simplified visual design. By
                    confining the Kaiser Permanente brand palette
                    to six colors in the 
                    <a href="https://myhrwd-status.herokuapp.com/colors.html">style guide</a>, our website easily passed

                    practices and the basics of product

                <p>
                    The CIO Chief of Staff approached my team to
                    create emergency department real-time
                    location services pilot for iPad and iPhone.
                    We helped department staff locate one
                    another to increase the number of doctor and
                    nurse meetings at the patient bedside over a
                    5-week pilot period. We worked with business
                    strategy, infrastructure teams, clinical
                    directors, doctors and nurses on the ground.

                    department staff: doctors, nurses and
                    technicians. I combined this knowledge with
                    interviews and observations that we did to
                    help the team learn what was most important
                    to build into our app.

                    nurses to give feedback over video
                    conference. I created high-fidelity
                    wireframes for a role-playing session where
                    I lead physician executives through an
                    emergency department scenario using the app,

                <p>
                    Beyond role-playing, I collaborated with my
                    team's lead engineer, product manager and
                    tester to build a working prototype of the
                    mobile app in Kaiser Permanente's Innovation
                    Center. We tested sensor boundaries and
                    latency on our mobile app to ensure that
                    locating people and equipment on a map felt
                    natural. Two months of prototype feedback
                    gave us the confidence to move to the pilot

                <h4>Pilot Program</h4>
                <p>
                    Connecting to the emergency department
                    sensor network took time. After struggling
                    with deadlines, we piloted the app for 5
                    weeks, encouraging nurse managers to share
                    the technology with their staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adoption of the pilot app was lower than
                    expected. I managed researchers hired
                    outside Kaiser Permanente to check our
                    hypothesis that emergency department staff
                    wanted to find each other and equipment. We
                    found our hypothesis did not show the whole
                    picture. During the pilot, staff adjusted
                    their needs if they couldn't find someone or
                    something. They looked for equipment and
                    people as a last resort. Interviews after
                    the pilot confirmed that nurses and
                    technicians would prefer to augment their
                    current voice communication system instead
                    of using a mobile app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our pilot was successful as a
                    proof-of-technology. Sensors for real-time
                    location services were already installed in
                    many Kaiser Permanente hospitals and my team
                    contributed infrastructure knowledge,
                    reusable development components and
                    documentation for teams to build upon.

                    <a href="http://bonfireschool.com/">
                    Bonfire School</a> is an organization and
                    community built around design and health. We
                    bring together people of any background to
                    create what they want &ndash; crafts,
                    software, dance and more &ndash; in a place
                    that supports personal health. Our dream is
                    that it can become a physical school one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project began as a series of

                    Currently, I'm researching wellbeing
                    across cultures to understand how
                    restorative practices &ndash; the things we do as
                    humans to regain equilibrium when we fall
                    off-balance &ndash; are passed on to future
                    generations.

                <h4>Public Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    These classes aim to make learning with an
                    software industry professional fun and engaging.
                    Through a series of group exercises student
                    are prompted to think about the needs of
                    others and how we can solve their problems
                    with software.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class.<dt>

                <p>
                    In this series, student learn to listen and
                    spend time with others to know what they
                    need; we design software based on those
                    needs and draw pictures to tell the story of
                    what we can build; then we build software
                    with Python and change it until it meets the
                    needs we've identified.

                    <strong>Typography and print projects</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My design work is heavily inspired by <a href="http://emigre.com/">Emigre</a> 
                    and <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1920/jan-tschichold/">Jan Tschichold</a>.
                    As a typesetter in my youth, I studied the
                    history and craft of typography while
                    working at a letterpress print shop.
                    Everything I do is grounded in the
                    principles of modern graphic design, grid
                    systems and balance.

                <p>
                    I produced trade show flyers for a home
                    performance contracting firm. Potential
                    customers could pick up the flyers and feel
                    blind-embossed card stock printed in earth
                    tones. It was meant to evoke a connection to
                    health and comfort in the home.
