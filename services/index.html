                <h2>Tell me your story</h2>
                <p>
                    Expressing what I see in the world is my life. Working with people means that we learn together and if you are writing about design and business, or producing the next disruptive app, I'm here to help. <a href="http://www.louisrawlins.com/contact">Contact me</a> to learn what I can offer you.

                <h2>Agile and software design consulting</h2>
                <p>
                    Software is complex and it's hard to know where to start. Let me help. Whether you're just building a Minimum Viable Product, or you've built a steady prototype a year ago, there is always room for improvement. I can help your engineers translate the language of design, support your designers to connect more with customers, or help the whole team get on-board with how they think about products and how to communicate for comprehension. The hard work comes first, but I assure you we'll have fun. <em>Rates start at $120/hour.</em>
                </p>
                <h2>Non-fiction writing and editing</h2>
                <p>
                    Business and design are more important than ever. I've hired and led software design teams at Kaiser Permanente and Capital One. I've hustled at break-neck speed with startups   acquired by Facebook and Yahoo! I'm comfortable talking to anyone &ndash; customers, support, software engineers, testers, product managers, executives and designers. I write regular articles on technology and social impact, as well as health and wellness. My ability to become a subject matter expert in a matter of weeks brings depth to any story. Let me help you focus and share your work to connect with your audience. <em>Rates start at $70/hour.</em>
                </p>
