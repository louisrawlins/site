                <h2>Technical writing, editing and layout</h2>
                <p>
                    I've hired and led software design teams at Kaiser Permanente and Capital One. I've hustled at break-neck speed with startups   acquired by Facebook and Yahoo!

                <h2>Non-fiction writing and editing</h2>
                <p>
                    I write regularly technology and social impact, as well as health and wellness. My ability to become a subject matter expert in a matter of weeks brings depth to any story. Let me help you focus and share your work to connect with your audience. <em>Rates start at $50/hour.</em>

                <h2>Creative non-fiction editing</h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to believe my life could be the same as anyone else until I got older. When I was a child, it was clear that I didn't fit in. Spending more time at the doctors office than the schoolyard gave me perspective on the importance of being alive. I've found a community in sharing my story. Everyone is still unique but it's wonderful when it becomes clear that we can be a community of unique people rather than feeling outcast. If this resonates with you, I encourage you to contact me. We can work together on your essay, short story or manuscript. <em>Rates start at $50/hour.</em>                    
                </p>
