                <h2>Let's work together</h2>
                <p>
                    Expressing what I see in the world is my life. Working with people means that we learn together and if you are writing about design and business, or getting thoughts down in a memoir or novel, I'm here to help. <a href="http://www.louisrawlins.com/contact">Contact me</a> to learn what I can offer you.

                <h2>Non-fiction writing and editing</h2>
                <p>
                    Business and design are more important than ever. I've hired and led software design teams at Kaiser Permanente and Capital One. I've hustled at break-neck speed with startups   acquired by Facebook and Yahoo! I'm comfortable talking to anyone&mdash;customers, support, software engineers, testers, product managers, executives and designers. I write regular articles on technology and social impact, as well as health and wellness. My ability to become a subject matter expert in a matter of weeks brings depth to any story. Let me help you focus and share your work to connect with your audience. <em>Rates start at $70/hour.</em>
                </p>
                <h2>Creative non-fiction and fiction editing</h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to believe my life was like anyone else's when I was younger. As I share stories, I find community. I'm here to get to know your story so that it resonates with your voice. We can work together on your essay, short story, or manuscript. <em>Rates start at $50/hour.</em>                    
                </p>
