    I must begin with a precaution and a confession. When, in order to approach a philosophy, one is armed not only with a pair of concepts—here, “structure and genesis”—that has been determined or overburdened with reminiscences by a long problematical trad- ition, but also with a speculative grid in which the classical figure of an antagonism is apparent from the start, then the operative debate which one prepares to undertake from within this philosophy, or on the basis of it, is in danger of appearing to be not so much an atten- tive scrutiny as a putting into question, that is, an abusive investiga- tion which introduces beforehand what it seeks to find, and does violence to the physiology proper to a body of thought. No doubt, to treat a philosophy by introducing the foreign substance of a debate may be efficacious, may surrender or set free the meaning of a latent process, but it begins with an aggression and an infidelity. We must not forget this.

    In the case at hand, this is truer than ever. Husserl has always indi- cated his aversion for debate, dilemma, and aporia, that is, for reflection in the alternative mode whereby the philosopher, at the end of his deliberations, seeks to reach a conclusion, that is, to close the question, 194 writing and difference to enclose his expectations or his concern in an option, a decision, a solution; and this would be the result of a speculative or “dialectical” attitude, in the sense that Husserl, at least, always sought to ascribe to this word. Not only are the metaphysicians guilty of this attitude, but often, unbeknownst to themselves, so are the adherents of the empir- ical sciences: both groups would be congenitally guilty of a certain sin of explicationism. The phenomenologist, on the contrary, is the “true positivist” who returns to the things themselves, and who is self- effacing before the originality and primordiality of meanings. The pro- cess of a faithful comprehension or description, and the continuity of explication must dispel the shadow of a choice. Thus one might say, and in an entirely prejudicial fashion, that Husserl, by his rejection of system and speculative closure, and by virtue of the style of his thought, is attuned to the historicity of meaning and to the possibility of its becoming, and is also already respectful of that which remains open within structure. And even when one comes to think that the opening of the structure is “structural,” that is, essential, one already has progressed to an order heterogeneous to the first one: the difference between the (necessarily closed) minor structure and the structurality of an opening—such, perhaps, is the unlocatable site in which phil- osophy takes root. Particularly when it speaks of and describes struc- tures. Thus, the presumption of a conflict between the genetic approach and the structural approach from the outset appears to be superimposed upon the specificity of what is given to a virgin glance. And if the question “structure or genesis” had been exposed to Husserl ex abrupto, I wager that he would have been quite astonished to see himself called into such a debate; he would have answered that it depends upon what one intends to speak about. There are some givens which must be described in terms of structure, and others which must be described in terms of genesis. There are layers of meaning which appear as systems, or complexes, or static configurations, within which, moreover, are possible a movement and a genesis which must obey both the legality proper to and the functional significance of the structure under consideration. Other layers, sometimes more pro- found, sometimes more superficial, are given in the essential mode of creation and movement, that is, in the modes of primordial origin, of becoming, or of tradition; and these require that in speaking of them one use the language of genesis, supposing that there is one, or that there is only one.
