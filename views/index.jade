      I'm primarily interested in learning and how people are drawn to build community.
      </div>
      <div>
      When I'm at work, I do a few things:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>I uncover business insights by talking to people and getting to know them</li>
        <li>I draw, create mock-ups, and build lightweight prototypes to prove ideas, and</li>
        <li>I facilitate teams to release software or solutions that reflect these insights and ideas</li>
      </ul>
      Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> to learn more. Thanks for stopping by.
