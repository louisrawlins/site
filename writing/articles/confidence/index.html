                        Violence was security to me. It kept me safe in high school. At heavy metal shows I kicked, pushed and shoved my way to a bloody peace. The mosh pit was full of likeminded youth. Each assault was an opportunity to feel. <small><a href="#reference-book-waking_the_tiger">[1,</a><a href="#reference-book-in_an_unspoken_voice">2]</a></small>

                        At school, friends would ask, "How are you?" and I would respond honestly&mdash;with a thorough assessment of my gastrointestinal distress. They would grimace and turn away, so I learned the pat response, "I'm fine." Each time I said this, I knew I would be back at the doctor's office soon. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was a research subject every week. Nurses drew my blood. Doctors inserted devices and pressed cold fingers on my stomach. They asked, "Where does it hurt?" and it was humiliating. Often I held onto the pain and said nothing. What they didn't know couldn't hurt them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My habit grew as an adult. I ignored instinct and pushed away desire. Friends, relationships, jobs all seemed less important than disappearing. I treated the workplace as performance art and when it felt like I had any success, I left. I quit in fear of what would happen next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my mid-thirties, my father and I visited Sweden. We stayed at a friend's apartment for a month. We saw cathedrals, parks and bridges. We bathed in the fading Midnight Sun. I took photographs at night and I worked for a startup back home, practiced yoga and went sight-seeing during the day. It was exhausting. <sup><a href="#note-midnight_sun">*</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My father's birthday was that month and we went out for dinner with our friend. For days, I'd been tired. Every move at dinner felt hopeless. I could barely drink water. We were at a restaurant, but even so I laid in my father's lap. I was certain I was dying and that it was the best thing ever. As I reached for my water on the table, I felt joyful. Peaceful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A moment later, I woke up with my face against the table. Not dead, I was covered with dark blood and fluid. I'd vomited on the table (and my shoes). We waited for an ambulance to take me to the emergency room. They washed me up and let me go back to the apartment. That night, I fainted on the floor. We returned to the hospital and they pumped my stomach before admitting me. Doctors transfused two pints of blood to treat my bleeding ulcer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My father came to see me every day. He was terrified and so was I. But even in the hospital I was occupied with testing my strength. I continued doing yoga and tried to ignore his visits. Every time the nurse checked on me, I demanded to know my test results. She would declined. I was certain something was lost in translation, so I insisted. Every nurse I spoke to refused to share my test results, but kept bringing me fruit juice and vegetables when I requested. My job was to stay put, eat and sleep. I was there for four days. <sup><a href="#note-test_results">**</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The morning before I left the hospital, I took a walk. Shuffling down the hall in my robe and booties, I asked my nurse how I could go outside. She pointed to the elevator. I was bemused and took it to the ground floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Walking slowly, I passed hospital staff. I was certain they would report me for leaving my room. Instead, they kept an eye on me. There was a bench on the wall every ten feet in case I got tired. And I was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside, I sat on a bench in the garden. It was cold but beautiful. Pink roses glistened in the morning fog. I felt lucky to be there. Lucky to be alive. I felt a warmth at the hospital I hadn't that whole month. During my trip, I complained that nobody in Sweden makes eye contact in the supermarket. Yet when it came down to it, the hospital staff showed up for me in a way that I was unable to do for myself. <small><a href="#reference-book-the_charisma_myth">[3,</a><a href="#reference-book-tribal_leadership">4]</a></small>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They showed me that I could trust myself. Without fuss, the hospital staff reminded me that I am supported by others. It was just as possible I could have seen myself as isolated and alone. I frequently feel that way when I'm sick. But I have friends and I have family. People support me. Love and friendship surrounds me. It gives me the confidence I need to support myself and the ones I love.

                            <a href="https://visitsweden.com/midnight-sun/">The Midnight Sun</a> actually happens in Swedish Lapland which is far north of where I visited in Stockholm and some of the surrounding cities. In Lapland, it's said that when you watch the sunset you see the sun dip then rise again in a continuous day. Even while I was in Stockholm, there was a dim glow until 11:30pm at night. It was awe-inspiring and gave a sort of "softness" to the evenings.

                            When I was healthy enough to get out of bed and eat with the other patients (an experience unique to me as community meals are unfamiliar in American hospitals), the nurses let me know why they were withholding my test results. My blood count was far below normal when I was admitted to the hospital, which meant that I was at risk of needing another transfusion. Put another way, my nurses didn't want to tell me news that might activate my ulcer since they were already uncertain whether I'd stopped losing blood. Rather than tell me news that might make my condition worse, they withheld information in an act of compassion. It worked. I slept and zoned out for a few days because they kept feeding me and checking-in on me, letting me know that it was safe to rest. I cannot say the same about my time in American hospitals, where you are frequently made to feel like you are a burden and need to leave as quickly as possible to "rest at home." Experience tells me that a hospital is the best place to rest because there are people there who are qualified and ready to help you heal. Unfortunately, many health systems in America do not have the emotional or financial support that doctors and nurses need to give patients the time and space they need to heal.

                            You may notice that I use Amazon Affiliate Links for referenced work. Take a moment to consider how this changes your perception of my work. There is a struggle right now, between people feeling comfortable paying directly for work created by artists and letting information be "free" for the consumer of that media. Living in a major city, I've had more than a glimpse of what it means to be poor. I'm keenly aware of my need to make money for any time I spend writing or producing. Collecting money for ads on my website is one way for me to earn money, but I worry that advertising dilutes the intent behind my work. What do you think? People like  <a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/" />Jaron Lanier</a> have given this some thought. He's proposed <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/05/jaron-lanier-wants-to-build-a-new-middle-class-on-micropayments/" />ways we can change this,</a> but we're far away from this being a conversation in culture at large. <a href="https://twitter.com/louisrawlins/" />Give me a holler</a> and let's keep the conversation going. If you're not already feeling this conflict, you will in the coming decades.

                            <br /><br />
                            Old habits are hard to break, but if the strategy you've learned for feeling any emotion at all is to inflict pain, it will be one you'll repeat. Peter Levine gives an excellent guide on how to move safely from repeating old, painful patterns to supportive ways of caring for yourself.

                            The nurses that cared for me demonstrated the kind of confidence that I strive for today. By being both attentive and firm in their care for me they demonstrated the kind of "power and warmth" that is perceived as charisma as outlined in this book. Thanks to Dave Logan for sharing this connection in his work on Tribal Rainmakers.

                            Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization</a>
                            by Dave Logan, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright (2008).                            
                            <br /><br />
                            Shortly after my experience in Stockholm, I purchased this book. It's influenced how I think about group dynamics ever since. At the time, I was frustrated by a group collaboration where I seemed to be resolving arguments more than I wished. Though it was natural for me to act as a go-between in that group, I was reaching my limit. I bought this book to help.
                            <br /><br />
                            Among many useful insights in this book is the idea that there are "levers" you can use to help people that are otherwise concerned with their own survival rather than getting along with others. Though the book is set in a business context it applies to life in general. When I was in the hospital, I was scared and defensive. I wanted people to care for me and I wanted them to leave me alone&mdash;in short, I had a conflict of needs. My nurses handled this effortlessly. In four days, they helped me move from being a person who was angry and speaking to few people, to a person that spent time with others and made my own lunch. This support and how it changed me was subtle but effective.
                            <br /><br />
