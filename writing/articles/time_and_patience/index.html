                    What am I doing? Three years gone by since I've written anything that sounds like my voice. Those three years too me in directions that made it hard to balance. Lots of struggles. Lots of false-started. Lots of learning. It took time and that's the point. I'm learning.

                    Publishing this article was a private challenge for me. The few that know me closely have seen me share written work, but they've also seen me drop the ball. Move house a couple of times. Focus on unrelated projects. Watched my health fail. I stumbled through jobs where I felt successful, but found it hard to put my health first. A lack of exercise made things worse. That you're reading this now is a testament to the time and patience it took to bring it all together. <sup><a href="#note-the_internet_today_scares_me">*</a></sup>

                    When I started this article, it was in reponse to the software design community here in San Francisco. Some of you may know the inner-workings of this community, but I hope and believe that many do not. I'll offer my own perspective, acknowleding that I'm deep in what's now considered part of Silicon Valley. To wit, it was not so long ago that a book called Lean Startup was published. It drew insight startups and how to learn from the experimental method. [1] Essentially, it recognized that product development is a process where you can start with a hypothesis, then test that hypothesis by getting feedback. Think of a grade school science fair project and you get the idea. There's alot of truth to this. You can indeed build a better product for people if you talk to them, modify your product, then continue to measure and learn what works. It inspired a book, which inspired me heavily.

                    In 2014, Lean UX borrowed this approach as applied to software design. It took the same experimental method proposed proposed Lean Startup and distilled it to focus on a "build-measure-learn" cycle. [2] I first encountered Lean UX at an event in San Francisco. I met people in the community and got a better understanding of what was happening. [3] It changed quickly. From my perspective, this nascent community was excited about the idea but became fragmented barely a year after Lean UX was published. New topics flourished: Lean Startup, Lean UX, Lean Enterprise, Lean Career, Lean Customer Development, Lean Analytics, Lean In, 85% Lean Hamburger. The concept of learning from feedback flickered out of focus and took a backseat to whatever someone wanted to sell. In this context, "lean" is named after a manufacturing process focused on eliminating waste through feedback and empowering employees to work more efficiently. Toyota was a pioneered this idea on their assembly lines. Contrary to its origin, I saw a proliferation of ideas around Lean Startup and Lean UX rather than a consolidation behind it. [4] Being the cynic that I am, I wanted to illustrate how this fragmentation amounted to bringing it back to life itself. The wonderful illustration you see at the top of this article is the result, though the humor has worn on me since it was made. <sup><a href="#note-andre_jolicoeur_lean_life_illustration">**</a></sup>

                    Everything that I've done since high school was in collaboration with others. When I worked at restaurants bussing tables and washing dishes, I was helped the cooks who needed dishes, the wait staff who needed tables cleared and the owner who needed help stocking the refrigerator. As a typesetter and graphic deisgner, I would work with the client to define what we would make, the proofreader to ensure we nailed it and I would stand on the printshop floor with the owner and the printer to make sure everything we'd hoped was created. It was the same as an artist, where I've worked with sculptors, musicians, curators and engineers to make work. It's always been a group effort.

                        * The internet today scares me a little. When I was a teenager over twenty years ago, it was a different and exciting place. Of course, the internet is not actually a place, but a method by which we've agreed to communicate with one another. It's useful never to forget that -- we are not obligated to use email, websites or Facebook -- but for the purposes of my story, it's useful to think of the internet as a place. It was a place that allowed me to be socially awkward and learn my way around people. It was also a place lurking with nasty people and mean ideas. This hasn't changed -- either before or after the internet -- but today I see a sort of brutish acceptance of what we now call "bullying" in text message and rail against on newsblogs and Facebook. This is problematic for many reasons, if only because these conversations are frequently happening over mediums where we do not own the information and the most inflammatory statement increases advertising revenue. In order to preserve the sort of openness that I cherish, please <a href="mailto:email@louisrawlins.com">email me</a> to continue a dialogue. I trust that you will be polite, but of course, I can't guarantee anything. It's a chance I'm willing to take for the freedom of exchange of ideas.
