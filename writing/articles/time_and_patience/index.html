                    I've never had strong career aspirations, except to share with the world what I've learned humans and society. And to create beauty. That's why I write. It's a chance to learn and to see what I know. How I am in the world. That's what I hope to share here in this article and in the projects before me. [2, Bonfire School]

                    Everything that I've done since high school was in collaboration with others. When I worked at restaurants bussing tables and washing dishes, I was helped the cooks who needed dishes, the wait staff who needed tables cleared and the owner who needed help stocking the refrigerator. As a typesetter and graphic deisgner, I would work with the client to define what we would make, the proofreader to ensure we nailed it and I would stand on the printshop floor with the owner and the printer to make sure everything we'd hoped was created. It was the same as an artist, where I've worked with sculptors, musicians, curators and engineers to make work. It's always been a group effort.

                    Imagine my surprise then, when I started to work as a software designer five years ago, and I saw a tendancy for people to want to work alone. On design, no less! I would be offered work, a client and an outcome, and then told that I needed to deliver at a certain date. With little to no input from anyone! It's only gotten worse since I started.
